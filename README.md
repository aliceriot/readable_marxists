# Readable Marxists

This is a little chrome extension that injects a stylesheet into pages on
[marxists.org](https://www.marxists.org) to make the articles hosted there
a little bit easier to read.

You can install it from the chrome web store
[here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/readable-marxists/kfcaoeebifndjjpnnlplkejkhogjoell).
